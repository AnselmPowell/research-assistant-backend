**Abstract**:

Expensive sensors and inefficient algorithmic pipelines significantly affect the overall cost of autonomous machines. However, affordable robotic solutions are essential to practical usage, and their financial impact constitutes a fundamental requirement to employ service robotics in most fields of application. Among all, researchers in the precision agriculture domain strive to devise robust and cost-effective autonomous platforms in order to provide genuinely large-scale competitive solutions. In this article, we present a complete algorithmic pipeline for row-based crops autonomous navigation, specifically designed to cope with low-range sensors and seasonal variations. Firstly, we build on a robust data-driven methodology to generate a viable path for the autonomous machine, covering the full extension of the crop with only the occupancy grid map information of the field. Moreover, our solution leverages on latest advancement of deep learning optimization techniques and synthetic generation of data to provide an affordable solution that efficiently tackles the well-known Global Navigation Satellite System unreliability and degradation due to vegetation growing inside rows. Extensive experimentation and simulations against computer-generated environments and real-world crops demonstrated the robustness and intrinsic generalizability of our methodology that opens the possibility of highly affordable and fully autonomous machines.

- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.04027v1.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Increased demand for less invasive procedures has accelerated the adoption of Intraluminal Procedures (IP) and Endovascular Interventions (EI) performed through body lumens and vessels. As navigation through lumens and vessels is quite complex, interest grows to establish autonomous navigation techniques for IP and EI for reaching the target area. Current research efforts are directed toward increasing the Level of Autonomy (LoA) during the navigation phase. One key ingredient for autonomous navigation is Motion Planning (MP) techniques. This paper provides an overview of MP techniques categorizing them based on LoA. Our analysis investigates advances for the different clinical scenarios. Through a systematic literature analysis using the PRISMA method, the study summarizes relevant works and investigates the clinical aim, LoA, adopted MP techniques, and validation types. We identify the limitations of the corresponding MP methods and provide directions to improve the robustness of the algorithms in dynamic intraluminal environments. MP for IP and EI can be classified into four subgroups: node, sampling, optimization, and learning-based techniques, with a notable rise in learning-based approaches in recent years. One of the review's contributions is the identification of the limiting factors in IP and EI robotic systems hindering higher levels of autonomous navigation. In the future, navigation is bound to become more autonomous, placing the clinician in a supervisory position to improve control precision and reduce workload.

- **Authors**: Yuhao Jiang, Serge El Asmar, Ziqiao Wang, Serhat Demirtas, Jamie Paik
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.19218v1
- **Date**: 2025-02-26
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19218v1.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Robotic manipulators often face challenges in handling objects of different sizes and materials, limiting their effectiveness in practical applications. This issue is particularly pronounced when manipulating meter-scale objects or those with varying stiffness, as traditional gripping techniques and strategies frequently prove inadequate. In this letter, we introduce a novel surface-based multi-module robotic manipulation framework that utilizes a Central Pattern Generator (CPG)-based motion generator, combined with a simulation-based optimization method to determine the optimal manipulation parameters for a multi-module origami robotic surface (Ori-Pixel). This approach allows for the manipulation of objects ranging from centimeters to meters in size, with varying stiffness and shape. The optimized CPG parameters are tested through both dynamic simulations and a series of prototype experiments involving a wide range of objects differing in size, weight, shape, and material, demonstrating robust manipulation capabilities.

- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09044v3.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Robotic fabric manipulation has applications in home robotics, textiles, senior care and surgery. Existing fabric manipulation techniques, however, are designed for specific tasks, making it difficult to generalize across different but related tasks. We extend the Visual Foresight framework to learn fabric dynamics that can be efficiently reused to accomplish different fabric manipulation tasks with a single goal-conditioned policy. We introduce VisuoSpatial Foresight (VSF), which builds on prior work by learning visual dynamics on domain randomized RGB images and depth maps simultaneously and completely in simulation. We experimentally evaluate VSF on multi-step fabric smoothing and folding tasks against 5 baseline methods in simulation and on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) surgical robot without any demonstrations at train or test time. Furthermore, we find that leveraging depth significantly improves performance. RGBD data yields an 80% improvement in fabric folding success rate over pure RGB data. Code, data, videos, and supplementary material are available at https://sites.google.com/view/fabric-vsf/.

- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20808v1.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Machine learning has facilitated significant advancements across various robotics domains, including navigation, locomotion, and manipulation. Many such achievements have been driven by the extensive use of simulation as a critical tool for training and testing robotic systems prior to their deployment in real-world environments. However, simulations consist of abstractions and approximations that inevitably introduce discrepancies between simulated and real environments, known as the reality gap. These discrepancies significantly hinder the successful transfer of systems from simulation to the real world. Closing this gap remains one of the most pressing challenges in robotics. Recent advances in sim-to-real transfer have demonstrated promising results across various platforms, including locomotion, navigation, and manipulation. By leveraging techniques such as domain randomization, real-to-sim transfer, state and action abstractions, and sim-real co-training, many works have overcome the reality gap. However, challenges persist, and a deeper understanding of the reality gap's root causes and solutions is necessary. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the sim-to-real landscape, highlighting the causes, solutions, and evaluation metrics for the reality gap and sim-to-real transfer.

### 6. A 64mW DNN-based Visual Navigation Engine for Autonomous Nano-Drones

- **Authors**: Daniele Palossi, Antonio Loquercio, Francesco Conti, Eric Flamand, Davide Scaramuzza, Luca Benini
- **arXiv ID**: 1805.01831v4
- **Date**: 2018-05-04
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01831v4.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Fully-autonomous miniaturized robots (e.g., drones), with artificial intelligence (AI) based visual navigation capabilities are extremely challenging drivers of Internet-of-Things edge intelligence capabilities. Visual navigation based on AI approaches, such as deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming pervasive for standard-size drones, but are considered out of reach for nanodrones with size of a few cm${}^\mathrm{2}$. In this work, we present the first (to the best of our knowledge) demonstration of a navigation engine for autonomous nano-drones capable of closed-loop end-to-end DNN-based visual navigation. To achieve this goal we developed a complete methodology for parallel execution of complex DNNs directly on-bard of resource-constrained milliwatt-scale nodes. Our system is based on GAP8, a novel parallel ultra-low-power computing platform, and a 27 g commercial, open-source CrazyFlie 2.0 nano-quadrotor. As part of our general methodology we discuss the software mapping techniques that enable the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network presented in [1] to be fully executed on-board within a strict 6 fps real-time constraint with no compromise in terms of flight results, while all processing is done with only 64 mW on average. Our navigation engine is flexible and can be used to span a wide performance range: at its peak performance corner it achieves 18 fps while still consuming on average just 3.5% of the power envelope of the deployed nano-aircraft.

- **Date**: 2024-11-08
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05337v1.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Localization and navigation are two crucial issues for mobile robots. In this paper, we propose an approach for localization and navigation systems for a differential-drive robot based on monocular SLAM. The system is implemented on the Robot Operating System (ROS). The hardware includes a differential-drive robot with an embedded computing platform (Jetson Xavier AGX), a 2D camera, and a LiDAR sensor for collecting external environmental information. The A* algorithm and Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) are used for path planning based on a 2D grid map. The ORB_SLAM3 algorithm is utilized to extract environmental features, providing the robot's pose for the localization and navigation processes. Finally, the system is tested in the Gazebo simulation environment and visualized through Rviz, demonstrating the efficiency and potential of the system for indoor localization and navigation of mobile robots.

- **arXiv ID**: 2405.09375v2
- **Date**: 2024-05-15
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09375v2.pdf)

**Abstract**:

This research reports VascularPilot3D, the first 3D fully autonomous endovascular robot navigation system. As an exploration toward autonomous guidewire navigation, VascularPilot3D is developed as a complete navigation system based on intra-operative imaging systems (fluoroscopic X-ray in this study) and typical endovascular robots. VascularPilot3D adopts previously researched fast 3D-2D vessel registration algorithms and guidewire segmentation methods as its perception modules. We additionally propose three modules: a topology-constrained 2D-3D instrument end-point lifting method, a tree-based fast path planning algorithm, and a prior-free endovascular navigation strategy. VascularPilot3D is compatible with most mainstream endovascular robots. Ex-vivo experiments validate that VascularPilot3D achieves 100% success rate among 25 trials. It reduces the human surgeon's overall control loops by 18.38%. VascularPilot3D is promising for general clinical autonomous endovascular navigations.

### 9. Fully Autonomous Real-World Reinforcement Learning with Applications to Mobile Manipulation

- **Authors**: Charles Sun, Jędrzej Orbik, Coline Devin, Brian Yang, Abhishek Gupta, Glen Berseth, Sergey Levine
- **arXiv ID**: 2107.13545v3
- **Date**: 2021-07-28
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13545v3.pdf)

**Abstract**:

We study how robots can autonomously learn skills that require a combination of navigation and grasping. While reinforcement learning in principle provides for automated robotic skill learning, in practice reinforcement learning in the real world is challenging and often requires extensive instrumentation and supervision. Our aim is to devise a robotic reinforcement learning system for learning navigation and manipulation together, in an autonomous way without human intervention, enabling continual learning under realistic assumptions. Our proposed system, ReLMM, can learn continuously on a real-world platform without any environment instrumentation, without human intervention, and without access to privileged information, such as maps, objects positions, or a global view of the environment. Our method employs a modularized policy with components for manipulation and navigation, where manipulation policy uncertainty drives exploration for the navigation controller, and the manipulation module provides rewards for navigation. We evaluate our method on a room cleanup task, where the robot must navigate to and pick up items scattered on the floor. After a grasp curriculum training phase, ReLMM can learn navigation and grasping together fully automatically, in around 40 hours of autonomous real-world training.

- **Authors**: Maria Makarova, Daria Trinitatova, Qian Liu, Dzmitry Tsetserukou
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.07801v3
- **Date**: 2024-10-10
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07801v3.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Many modern robotic systems operate autonomously, however they often lack the ability to accurately analyze the environment and adapt to changing external conditions, while teleoperation systems often require special operator skills. In the field of laboratory automation, the number of automated processes is growing, however such systems are usually developed to perform specific tasks. In addition, many of the objects used in this field are transparent, making it difficult to analyze them using visual channels. The contributions of this work include the development of a robotic framework with autonomous mode for manipulating liquid-filled objects with different degrees of transparency in complex pose combinations. The conducted experiments demonstrated the robustness of the designed visual perception system to accurately estimate object poses for autonomous manipulation, and confirmed the performance of the algorithms in dexterous operations such as liquid dispensing. The proposed robotic framework can be applied for laboratory automation, since it allows solving the problem of performing non-trivial manipulation tasks with the analysis of object poses of varying degrees of transparency and liquid levels, requiring high accuracy and repeatability.

### 11. Optimal Dimensioning of Elastic-Link Manipulators regarding Lifetime Estimation

- **Authors**: Klaus Zauner, Hubert Gattringer, Andreas Mueller
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.23234v1
- **Date**: 2025-10-27
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23234v1.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Resourceful operation and design of robots is key for sustainable industrial automation. This will be enabled by lightweight design along with time and energy optimal control of robotic manipulators. Design and control of such systems is intertwined as the control must take into account inherent mechanical compliance while the design must accommodate the dynamic requirements demanded by the control. As basis for such design optimization, a method for estimating the lifetime of elastic link robotic manipulators is presented. This is applied to the geometry optimization of flexible serial manipulators performing pick-and-place operations, where the optimization objective is a combination of overall weight and vibration amplitudes. The lifetime estimation draws from a fatigue analysis combining the rainflow counting algorithm and the method of critical cutting plane. Tresca hypothesis is used to formulate an equivalent stress, and linear damage accumulation is assumed. The final robot geometry is selected from a Pareto front as a tradeoff of lifetime and vibration characteristic. The method is illustrated for a three degrees of freedom articulated robotic manipulator.

### 13. A Survey of Knowledge Representation in Service Robotics

- **Authors**: David Paulius, Yu Sun
- **arXiv ID**: 1807.02192v4
- **Date**: 2018-07-05
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02192v4.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Within the realm of service robotics, researchers have placed a great amount of effort into learning, understanding, and representing motions as manipulations for task execution by robots. The task of robot learning and problem-solving is very broad, as it integrates a variety of tasks such as object detection, activity recognition, task/motion planning, localization, knowledge representation and retrieval, and the intertwining of perception/vision and machine learning techniques. In this paper, we solely focus on knowledge representations and notably how knowledge is typically gathered, represented, and reproduced to solve problems as done by researchers in the past decades. In accordance with the definition of knowledge representations, we discuss the key distinction between such representations and useful learning models that have extensively been introduced and studied in recent years, such as machine learning, deep learning, probabilistic modelling, and semantic graphical structures. Along with an overview of such tools, we discuss the problems which have existed in robot learning and how they have been built and used as solutions, technologies or developments (if any) which have contributed to solving them. Finally, we discuss key principles that should be considered when designing an effective knowledge representation.

### 14. Planning for robotic exploration based on forward simulation

- **Authors**: Mikko Lauri, Risto Ritala
- **arXiv ID**: 1502.02474v2
- **Date**: 2015-02-09
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.02474v2.pdf)

**Abstract**:

We address the problem of controlling a mobile robot to explore a partially known environment. The robot's objective is the maximization of the amount of information collected about the environment. We formulate the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with an information-theoretic objective function, and solve it applying forward simulation algorithms with an open-loop approximation. We present a new sample-based approximation for mutual information useful in mobile robotics. The approximation can be seamlessly integrated with forward simulation planning algorithms. We investigate the usefulness of POMDP based planning for exploration, and to alleviate some of its weaknesses propose a combination with frontier based exploration. Experimental results in simulated and real environments show that, depending on the environment, applying POMDP based planning for exploration can improve performance over frontier exploration.

### 16. Coordinated Multi-Robot Shared Autonomy Based on Scheduling and Demonstrations

- **Authors**: Michael Hagenow, Emmanuel Senft, Nitzan Orr, Robert Radwin, Michael Gleicher, Bilge Mutlu, Dylan P. Losey, Michael Zinn
- **arXiv ID**: 2303.15972v2
- **Date**: 2023-03-28
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15972v2.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Shared autonomy methods, where a human operator and a robot arm work together, have enabled robots to complete a range of complex and highly variable tasks. Existing work primarily focuses on one human sharing autonomy with a single robot. By contrast, in this paper we present an approach for multi-robot shared autonomy that enables one operator to provide real-time corrections across two coordinated robots completing the same task in parallel. Sharing autonomy with multiple robots presents fundamental challenges. The human can only correct one robot at a time, and without coordination, the human may be left idle for long periods of time. Accordingly, we develop an approach that aligns the robot's learned motions to best utilize the human's expertise. Our key idea is to leverage Learning from Demonstration (LfD) and time warping to schedule the motions of the robots based on when they may require assistance. Our method uses variability in operator demonstrations to identify the types of corrections an operator might apply during shared autonomy, leverages flexibility in how quickly the task was performed in demonstrations to aid in scheduling, and iteratively estimates the likelihood of when corrections may be needed to ensure that only one robot is completing an action requiring assistance. Through a preliminary study, we show that our method can decrease the scheduled time spent sanding by iteratively estimating the times when each robot could need assistance and generating an optimized schedule that allows the operator to provide corrections to each robot during these times.

### 17. OpenStreetMap-based Autonomous Navigation With LiDAR Naive-Valley-Path Obstacle Avoidance

- **Authors**: Miguel Angel Munoz-Banon, Edison Velasco-Sanchez, Francisco A. Candelas, Fernando Torres
- **arXiv ID**: 2108.09117v5
- **Date**: 2021-08-20
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09117v5.pdf)

**Abstract**:

OpenStreetMaps (OSM) is currently studied as the environment representation for autonomous navigation. It provides advantages such as global consistency, a heavy-less map construction process, and a wide variety of road information publicly available. However, the location of this information is usually not very accurate locally.
  In this paper, we present a complete autonomous navigation pipeline using OSM information as environment representation for global planning. To avoid the flaw of local low-accuracy, we offer the novel LiDAR-based Naive-Valley-Path (NVP) method that exploits the concept of "valley" areas to infer the local path always furthest from obstacles. This behavior allows navigation always through the center of trafficable areas following the road's shape independently of OSM error. Furthermore, NVP is a naive method that is highly sample-time-efficient. This time efficiency also enables obstacle avoidance, even for dynamic objects.
  We demonstrate the system's robustness in our research platform BLUE, driving autonomously across the University of Alicante Scientific Park for more than 20 km with 0.24 meters of average error against the road's center with a 19.8 ms of average sample time. Our vehicle avoids static obstacles in the road and even dynamic ones, such as vehicles and pedestrians.

### 18. Quantum Artificial Intelligence for Secure Autonomous Vehicle Navigation: An Architectural Proposal

- **Authors**: Hemanth Kannamarlapudi, Sowmya Chintalapudi
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.16000v1
- **Date**: 2025-06-19
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16000v1.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Navigation is a very crucial aspect of autonomous vehicle ecosystem which heavily relies on collecting and processing large amounts of data in various states and taking a confident and safe decision to define the next vehicle maneuver. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on Quantum Artificial Intelligence by enabling quantum and AI at various levels of navigation decision making and communication process in Autonomous vehicles : Quantum Neural Networks for multimodal sensor fusion, Nav-Q for Quantum reinforcement learning for navigation policy optimization and finally post-quantum cryptographic protocols for secure communication. Quantum neural networks uses quantum amplitude encoding to fuse data from various sensors like LiDAR, radar, camera, GPS and weather etc., This approach gives a unified quantum state representation between heterogeneous sensor modalities. Nav-Q module processes the fused quantum states through variational quantum circuits to learn optimal navigation policies under swift dynamic and complex conditions. Finally, post quantum cryptographic protocols are used to secure communication channels for both within vehicle communication and V2X (Vehicle to Everything) communications and thus secures the autonomous vehicle communication from both classical and quantum security threats. Thus, the proposed framework addresses fundamental challenges in autonomous vehicles navigation by providing quantum performance and future proof security.

### 19. Value-Based Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control Robotic Manipulation in Multi-Task Sparse Reward Settings

- **Authors**: Sreehari Rammohan, Shangqun Yu, Bowen He, Eric Hsiung, Eric Rosen, Stefanie Tellex, George Konidaris
- **arXiv ID**: 2107.13356v1
- **Date**: 2021-07-28
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13356v1.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Learning continuous control in high-dimensional sparse reward settings, such as robotic manipulation, is a challenging problem due to the number of samples often required to obtain accurate optimal value and policy estimates. While many deep reinforcement learning methods have aimed at improving sample efficiency through replay or improved exploration techniques, state of the art actor-critic and policy gradient methods still suffer from the hard exploration problem in sparse reward settings. Motivated by recent successes of value-based methods for approximating state-action values, like RBF-DQN, we explore the potential of value-based reinforcement learning for learning continuous robotic manipulation tasks in multi-task sparse reward settings. On robotic manipulation tasks, we empirically show RBF-DQN converges faster than current state of the art algorithms such as TD3, SAC, and PPO. We also perform ablation studies with RBF-DQN and have shown that some enhancement techniques for vanilla Deep Q learning such as Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) can also be applied to RBF-DQN. Our experimental analysis suggests that value-based approaches may be more sensitive to data augmentation and replay buffer sample techniques than policy-gradient methods, and that the benefits of these methods for robot manipulation are heavily dependent on the transition dynamics of generated subgoal states.

- **Authors**: Jan Ole von Hartz, Eugenio Chisari, Tim Welschehold, Abhinav Valada
- **arXiv ID**: 2205.08316v2
- **Date**: 2022-05-17
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.08316v2.pdf)

**Abstract**:

In recent years, policy learning methods using either reinforcement or imitation have made significant progress. However, both techniques still suffer from being computationally expensive and requiring large amounts of training data. This problem is especially prevalent in real-world robotic manipulation tasks, where access to ground truth scene features is not available and policies are instead learned from raw camera observations. In this paper, we demonstrate the efficacy of learning image keypoints via the Dense Correspondence pretext task for downstream policy learning. Extending prior work to challenging multi-object scenes, we show that our model can be trained to deal with important problems in representation learning, primarily scale-invariance and occlusion. We evaluate our approach on diverse robot manipulation tasks, compare it to other visual representation learning approaches, and demonstrate its flexibility and effectiveness for sample-efficient policy learning.
