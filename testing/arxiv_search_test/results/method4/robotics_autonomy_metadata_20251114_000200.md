### 1. Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Semi-Autonomous Control for Magnetic Micro-robot Navigation with Immersive Manipulation

- **Authors**: Yudong Mao, Dandan Zhang
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.06359v1
- **Date**: 2025-03-08
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06359v1.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Magnetic micro-robots have demonstrated immense potential in biomedical applications, such as in vivo drug delivery, non-invasive diagnostics, and cell-based therapies, owing to their precise maneuverability and small size. However, current micromanipulation techniques often rely solely on a two-dimensional (2D) microscopic view as sensory feedback, while traditional control interfaces do not provide an intuitive manner for operators to manipulate micro-robots. These limitations increase the cognitive load on operators, who must interpret limited feedback and translate it into effective control actions. To address these challenges, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Semi-Autonomous Control (DRL-SC) framework for magnetic micro-robot navigation in a simulated microvascular system. Our framework integrates Mixed Reality (MR) to facilitate immersive manipulation of micro-robots, thereby enhancing situational awareness and control precision. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves navigation efficiency, reduces control errors, and enhances the overall robustness of the system in simulated microvascular environments.

- **arXiv ID**: 2407.06118v1
- **Date**: 2024-07-08
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06118v1.pdf)

**Abstract**:

This paper presents a study on autonomous robot navigation, focusing on three key behaviors: Odometry, Target Tracking, and Obstacle Avoidance. Each behavior is described in detail, along with experimental setups for simulated and real-world environments. Odometry utilizes wheel encoder data for precise navigation along predefined paths, validated through experiments with a Pioneer robot. Target Tracking employs vision-based techniques for pursuing designated targets while avoiding obstacles, demonstrated on the same platform. Obstacle Avoidance utilizes ultrasonic sensors to navigate cluttered environments safely, validated in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Additionally, the paper extends the project to include an Elegoo robot car, leveraging its features for enhanced experimentation. Through advanced algorithms and experimental validations, this study provides insights into developing robust navigation systems for autonomous robots.

- **Date**: 2024-10-04
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03555v2.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Robust autonomous navigation in environments with limited visibility remains a critical challenge in robotics. We present a novel approach that leverages Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) sensing using single-photon LiDAR to improve visibility and enhance autonomous navigation. Our method enables mobile robots to "see around corners" by utilizing multi-bounce light information, effectively expanding their perceptual range without additional infrastructure. We propose a three-module pipeline: (1) Sensing, which captures multi-bounce histograms using SPAD-based LiDAR; (2) Perception, which estimates occupancy maps of hidden regions from these histograms using a convolutional neural network; and (3) Control, which allows a robot to follow safe paths based on the estimated occupancy. We evaluate our approach through simulations and real-world experiments on a mobile robot navigating an L-shaped corridor with hidden obstacles. Our work represents the first experimental demonstration of NLOS imaging for autonomous navigation, paving the way for safer and more efficient robotic systems operating in complex environments. We also contribute a novel dynamics-integrated transient rendering framework for simulating NLOS scenarios, facilitating future research in this domain.

### 4. Autonomous bot with ML-based reactive navigation for indoor environment

- **Authors**: Yash Srivastava, Saumya Singh, S. P. Syed Ibrahim
- **arXiv ID**: 2111.12542v1
- **Date**: 2021-11-24
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12542v1.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Local or reactive navigation is essential for autonomous mobile robots which operate in an indoor environment. Techniques such as SLAM, computer vision require significant computational power which increases cost. Similarly, using rudimentary methods makes the robot susceptible to inconsistent behavior. This paper aims to develop a robot that balances cost and accuracy by using machine learning to predict the best obstacle avoidance move based on distance inputs from four ultrasonic sensors that are strategically mounted on the front, front-left, front-right, and back of the robot. The underlying hardware consists of an Arduino Uno and a Raspberry Pi 3B. The machine learning model is first trained on the data collected by the robot. Then the Arduino continuously polls the sensors and calculates the distance values, and in case of critical need for avoidance, a suitable maneuver is made by the Arduino. In other scenarios, sensor data is sent to the Raspberry Pi using a USB connection and the machine learning model generates the best move for navigation, which is sent to the Arduino for driving motors accordingly. The system is mounted on a 2-WD robot chassis and tested in a cluttered indoor setting with most impressive results.

- **arXiv ID**: 1805.01831v4
- **Date**: 2018-05-04
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01831v4.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Fully-autonomous miniaturized robots (e.g., drones), with artificial intelligence (AI) based visual navigation capabilities are extremely challenging drivers of Internet-of-Things edge intelligence capabilities. Visual navigation based on AI approaches, such as deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming pervasive for standard-size drones, but are considered out of reach for nanodrones with size of a few cm${}^\mathrm{2}$. In this work, we present the first (to the best of our knowledge) demonstration of a navigation engine for autonomous nano-drones capable of closed-loop end-to-end DNN-based visual navigation. To achieve this goal we developed a complete methodology for parallel execution of complex DNNs directly on-bard of resource-constrained milliwatt-scale nodes. Our system is based on GAP8, a novel parallel ultra-low-power computing platform, and a 27 g commercial, open-source CrazyFlie 2.0 nano-quadrotor. As part of our general methodology we discuss the software mapping techniques that enable the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network presented in [1] to be fully executed on-board within a strict 6 fps real-time constraint with no compromise in terms of flight results, while all processing is done with only 64 mW on average. Our navigation engine is flexible and can be used to span a wide performance range: at its peak performance corner it achieves 18 fps while still consuming on average just 3.5% of the power envelope of the deployed nano-aircraft.

- **Date**: 2023-02-11
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05567v1.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Vitreoretinal surgery pertains to the treatment of delicate tissues on the fundus of the eye using thin instruments. Surgeons frequently rotate the eye during surgery, which is called orbital manipulation, to observe regions around the fundus without moving the patient. In this paper, we propose the autonomous orbital manipulation of the eye in robot-assisted vitreoretinal surgery with our tele-operated surgical system. In a simulation study, we preliminarily investigated the increase in the manipulability of our system using orbital manipulation. Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility of our method in experiments with a physical robot and a realistic eye model, showing an increase in the view-able area of the fundus when compared to a conventional technique.

- **Date**: 2024-07-13
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09890v2.pdf)

**Abstract**:

In social robotics, a pivotal focus is enabling robots to engage with humans in a more natural and seamless manner. The emergence of advanced large language models (LLMs) such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) and autoregressive models like Large Language Model Meta AI (Llamas) has driven significant advancements in integrating natural language understanding capabilities into social robots. This paper presents a system for speech-guided sequential planning in autonomous navigation, utilizing Llama3 and the Robot Operating System~(ROS). The proposed system involves using Llama3 to interpret voice commands, extracting essential details through parsing, and decoding these commands into sequential actions for tasks. Such sequential planning is essential in various domains, particularly in the pickup and delivery of an object. Once a sequential navigation task is evaluated, we employ DRL-VO, a learning-based control policy that allows a robot to autonomously navigate through social spaces with static infrastructure and (crowds of) people. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in simulation experiment using Turtlebot 2 in ROS1 and Turtlebot 3 in ROS2. We conduct hardware trials using a Clearpath Robotics Jackal UGV, highlighting its potential for real-world deployment in scenarios requiring flexible and interactive robotic behaviors.

### 8. On Deep Learning Techniques to Boost Monocular Depth Estimation for Autonomous Navigation

- **Authors**: Raul de Queiroz Mendes, Eduardo Godinho Ribeiro, Nicolas dos Santos Rosa, Valdir Grassi
- **arXiv ID**: 2010.06626v2
- **Date**: 2020-10-13
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.06626v2.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Inferring the depth of images is a fundamental inverse problem within the field of Computer Vision since depth information is obtained through 2D images, which can be generated from infinite possibilities of observed real scenes. Benefiting from the progress of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to explore structural features and spatial image information, Single Image Depth Estimation (SIDE) is often highlighted in scopes of scientific and technological innovation, as this concept provides advantages related to its low implementation cost and robustness to environmental conditions. In the context of autonomous vehicles, state-of-the-art CNNs optimize the SIDE task by producing high-quality depth maps, which are essential during the autonomous navigation process in different locations. However, such networks are usually supervised by sparse and noisy depth data, from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) laser scans, and are carried out at high computational cost, requiring high-performance Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). Therefore, we propose a new lightweight and fast supervised CNN architecture combined with novel feature extraction models which are designed for real-world autonomous navigation. We also introduce an efficient surface normals module, jointly with a simple geometric 2.5D loss function, to solve SIDE problems. We also innovate by incorporating multiple Deep Learning techniques, such as the use of densification algorithms and additional semantic, surface normals and depth information to train our framework. The method introduced in this work focuses on robotic applications in indoor and outdoor environments and its results are evaluated on the competitive and publicly available NYU Depth V2 and KITTI Depth datasets.

**Abstract**:

Expensive sensors and inefficient algorithmic pipelines significantly affect the overall cost of autonomous machines. However, affordable robotic solutions are essential to practical usage, and their financial impact constitutes a fundamental requirement to employ service robotics in most fields of application. Among all, researchers in the precision agriculture domain strive to devise robust and cost-effective autonomous platforms in order to provide genuinely large-scale competitive solutions. In this article, we present a complete algorithmic pipeline for row-based crops autonomous navigation, specifically designed to cope with low-range sensors and seasonal variations. Firstly, we build on a robust data-driven methodology to generate a viable path for the autonomous machine, covering the full extension of the crop with only the occupancy grid map information of the field. Moreover, our solution leverages on latest advancement of deep learning optimization techniques and synthetic generation of data to provide an affordable solution that efficiently tackles the well-known Global Navigation Satellite System unreliability and degradation due to vegetation growing inside rows. Extensive experimentation and simulations against computer-generated environments and real-world crops demonstrated the robustness and intrinsic generalizability of our methodology that opens the possibility of highly affordable and fully autonomous machines.

- **Date**: 2025-06-24
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19622v2.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Autonomous robots deployed in shared human environments, such as agricultural settings, require rigorous safety assurance to meet both functional reliability and regulatory compliance. These systems must operate in dynamic, unstructured environments, interact safely with humans, and respond effectively to a wide range of potential hazards. This paper presents a verification workflow for the safety assurance of an autonomous agricultural robot, covering the entire development life-cycle, from concept study and design to runtime verification. The outlined methodology begins with a systematic hazard analysis and risk assessment to identify potential risks and derive corresponding safety requirements. A formal model of the safety controller is then developed to capture its behaviour and verify that the controller satisfies the specified safety properties with respect to these requirements. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a field robot operating in an agricultural setting. The results show that the methodology can be effectively used to verify safety-critical properties and facilitate the early identification of design issues, contributing to the development of safer robots and autonomous systems.

### 12. OpenStreetMap-based Autonomous Navigation With LiDAR Naive-Valley-Path Obstacle Avoidance

- **Authors**: Miguel Angel Munoz-Banon, Edison Velasco-Sanchez, Francisco A. Candelas, Fernando Torres
- **arXiv ID**: 2108.09117v5
- **Date**: 2021-08-20
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09117v5.pdf)

**Abstract**:

OpenStreetMaps (OSM) is currently studied as the environment representation for autonomous navigation. It provides advantages such as global consistency, a heavy-less map construction process, and a wide variety of road information publicly available. However, the location of this information is usually not very accurate locally.
  In this paper, we present a complete autonomous navigation pipeline using OSM information as environment representation for global planning. To avoid the flaw of local low-accuracy, we offer the novel LiDAR-based Naive-Valley-Path (NVP) method that exploits the concept of "valley" areas to infer the local path always furthest from obstacles. This behavior allows navigation always through the center of trafficable areas following the road's shape independently of OSM error. Furthermore, NVP is a naive method that is highly sample-time-efficient. This time efficiency also enables obstacle avoidance, even for dynamic objects.
  We demonstrate the system's robustness in our research platform BLUE, driving autonomously across the University of Alicante Scientific Park for more than 20 km with 0.24 meters of average error against the road's center with a 19.8 ms of average sample time. Our vehicle avoids static obstacles in the road and even dynamic ones, such as vehicles and pedestrians.

**Abstract**:

Navigation is a very crucial aspect of autonomous vehicle ecosystem which heavily relies on collecting and processing large amounts of data in various states and taking a confident and safe decision to define the next vehicle maneuver. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on Quantum Artificial Intelligence by enabling quantum and AI at various levels of navigation decision making and communication process in Autonomous vehicles : Quantum Neural Networks for multimodal sensor fusion, Nav-Q for Quantum reinforcement learning for navigation policy optimization and finally post-quantum cryptographic protocols for secure communication. Quantum neural networks uses quantum amplitude encoding to fuse data from various sensors like LiDAR, radar, camera, GPS and weather etc., This approach gives a unified quantum state representation between heterogeneous sensor modalities. Nav-Q module processes the fused quantum states through variational quantum circuits to learn optimal navigation policies under swift dynamic and complex conditions. Finally, post quantum cryptographic protocols are used to secure communication channels for both within vehicle communication and V2X (Vehicle to Everything) communications and thus secures the autonomous vehicle communication from both classical and quantum security threats. Thus, the proposed framework addresses fundamental challenges in autonomous vehicles navigation by providing quantum performance and future proof security.

- **Date**: 2025-10-10
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09396v1.pdf)

**Abstract**:

Ensuring robust robotic navigation in dynamic environments is a key challenge, as traditional testing methods often struggle to cover the full spectrum of operational requirements. This paper presents the industrial adoption of Surrealist, a simulation-based test generation framework originally for UAVs, now applied to the ANYmal quadrupedal robot for industrial inspection. Our method uses a search-based algorithm to automatically generate challenging obstacle avoidance scenarios, uncovering failures often missed by manual testing. In a pilot phase, generated test suites revealed critical weaknesses in one experimental algorithm (40.3% success rate) and served as an effective benchmark to prove the superior robustness of another (71.2% success rate). The framework was then integrated into the ANYbotics workflow for a six-month industrial evaluation, where it was used to test five proprietary algorithms. A formal survey confirmed its value, showing it enhances the development process, uncovers critical failures, provides objective benchmarks, and strengthens the overall verification pipeline.

### 18. Social Zone as a Barrier Function for Socially-Compliant Robot Navigation

- **Authors**: Junwoo Jang, Maani Ghaffari
- **arXiv ID**: 2405.15101v2
- **Date**: 2024-05-23
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15101v2.pdf)

**Abstract**:

This study addresses the challenge of integrating social norms into robot navigation, which is essential for ensuring that robots operate safely and efficiently in human-centric environments. Social norms, often unspoken and implicitly understood among people, are difficult to explicitly define and implement in robotic systems. To overcome this, we derive these norms from real human trajectory data, utilizing the comprehensive ATC dataset to identify the minimum social zones humans and robots must respect. These zones are integrated into the robot's navigation system by applying barrier functions, ensuring the robot consistently remains within the designated safety set. Simulation results demonstrate that our system effectively mimics human-like navigation strategies, such as passing on the right side and adjusting speed or pausing in constrained spaces. The proposed framework is versatile, easily comprehensible, and tunable, demonstrating the potential to advance the development of robots designed to navigate effectively in human-centric environments.

- **Date**: 2023-09-26
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15234v2.pdf)

**Abstract**:

In public spaces shared with humans, ensuring multi-robot systems navigate without collisions while respecting social norms is challenging, particularly with limited communication. Although current robot social navigation techniques leverage advances in reinforcement learning and deep learning, they frequently overlook robot dynamics in simulations, leading to a simulation-to-reality gap. In this paper, we bridge this gap by presenting a new multi-robot social navigation environment crafted using Dec-POSMDP and multi-agent reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we introduce SAMARL: a novel benchmark for cooperative multi-robot social navigation. SAMARL employs a unique spatial-temporal transformer combined with multi-agent reinforcement learning. This approach effectively captures the complex interactions between robots and humans, thus promoting cooperative tendencies in multi-robot systems. Our extensive experiments reveal that SAMARL outperforms existing baseline and ablation models in our designed environment.

- **arXiv ID**: 2006.16235v1
- **Date**: 2020-06-29
- **URL**: [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16235v1.pdf)

**Abstract**:

We present Nav2Goal, a data-efficient and end-to-end learning method for goal-conditioned visual navigation. Our technique is used to train a navigation policy that enables a robot to navigate close to sparse geographic waypoints provided by a user without any prior map, all while avoiding obstacles and choosing paths that cover user-informed regions of interest. Our approach is based on recent advances in conditional imitation learning. General-purpose, safe and informative actions are demonstrated by a human expert. The learned policy is subsequently extended to be goal-conditioned by training with hindsight relabelling, guided by the robot's relative localization system, which requires no additional manual annotation. We deployed our method on an underwater vehicle in the open ocean to collect scientifically relevant data of coral reefs, which allowed our robot to operate safely and autonomously, even at very close proximity to the coral. Our field deployments have demonstrated over a kilometer of autonomous visual navigation, where the robot reaches on the order of 40 waypoints, while collecting scientifically relevant data. This is done while travelling within 0.5 m altitude from sensitive corals and exhibiting significant learned agility to overcome turbulent ocean conditions and to actively avoid collisions.
