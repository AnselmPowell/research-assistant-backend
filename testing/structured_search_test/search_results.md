### Improving Multilingual Math Reasoning for African Languages

- **Authors:** Odunayo Ogundepo, Akintunde Oladipo, Kelechi Ogueji, Esther Adenuga, David Ifeoluwa Adelani, Jimmy Lin
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.19848v1
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19848v1.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  Researchers working on low-resource languages face persistent challenges due
to limited data availability and restricted access to computational resources.
Although most large language models (LLMs) are predominantly trained in
high-resource languages, adapting them to low-resource contexts, particularly
African languages, requires specialized techniques. Several strategies have
emerged for adapting models to low-resource languages in todays LLM landscape,
defined by multi-stage pre-training and post-training paradigms. However, the
most effective approaches remain uncertain. This work syste...

### Designing and Contextualising Probes for African Languages

- **Authors:** Wisdom Aduah, Francois Meyer
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.10081v2
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10081v2.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  Pretrained language models (PLMs) for African languages are continually
improving, but the reasons behind these advances remain unclear. This paper
presents the first systematic investigation into probing PLMs for linguistic
knowledge about African languages. We train layer-wise probes for six
typologically diverse African languages to analyse how linguistic features are
distributed. We also design control tasks, a way to interpret probe
performance, for the MasakhaPOS dataset. We find PLMs adapted for African
languages to encode more linguistic information about target languages than
massiv...

### Introduction to the African Strategy for Fundamental and Applied Physics
  (ASFAP)

- **Authors:** Farida Fassi
- **arXiv ID:** 2206.09710v1
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.09710v1.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  Generating scientific and technological knowledge and converting them into
innovations which are of added value to society are key instruments for a
society economic growth and development. As outstanding as these capabilities
are for other regions in the world, Africa science, innovation, education and
research infrastructure, particularly in fundamental and applied physics, have
over the years been under valued and under resourced. To efficiently address
the scientific and technological gaps with the rest of the world, Africa stance
needs radical overhaul. With the big ambition to drive a ...

### Analysis of LLM as a grammatical feature tagger for African American
  English

- **Authors:** Rahul Porwal, Alice Rozet, Pryce Houck, Jotsna Gowda, Sarah Moeller, Kevin Tang
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.06004v1
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06004v1.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  African American English (AAE) presents unique challenges in natural language
processing (NLP). This research systematically compares the performance of
available NLP models--rule-based, transformer-based, and large language models
(LLMs)--capable of identifying key grammatical features of AAE, namely Habitual
Be and Multiple Negation. These features were selected for their distinct
grammatical complexity and frequency of occurrence. The evaluation involved
sentence-level binary classification tasks, using both zero-shot and few-shot
strategies. The analysis reveals that while LLMs show prom...

### In-Domain African Languages Translation Using LLMs and Multi-armed
  Bandits

- **Authors:** Pratik Rakesh Singh, Kritarth Prasad, Mohammadi Zaki, Pankaj Wasnik
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.15069v1
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15069v1.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems face significant challenges when
working with low-resource languages, particularly in domain adaptation tasks.
These difficulties arise due to limited training data and suboptimal model
generalization, As a result, selecting an optimal model for translation is
crucial for achieving strong performance on in-domain data, particularly in
scenarios where fine-tuning is not feasible or practical. In this paper, we
investigate strategies for selecting the most suitable NMT model for a given
domain using bandit-based algorithms, including Upper Confidence Bo...

- **arXiv ID:** 2505.11690v1
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11690v1.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies have transformed
human-computer interaction; however, low-resource languages in Africa remain
significantly underrepresented in both research and practical applications.
This study investigates the major challenges hindering the development of ASR
systems for these languages, which include data scarcity, linguistic
complexity, limited computational resources, acoustic variability, and ethical
concerns surrounding bias and privacy. The primary goal is to critically
analyze these barriers and identify practical, inclusive strategies to advance

### Building low-resource African language corpora: A case study of
  Kidawida, Kalenjin and Dholuo

- **Authors:** Audrey Mbogho, Quin Awuor, Andrew Kipkebut, Lilian Wanzare, Vivian Oloo
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.11003v1
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11003v1.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  Natural Language Processing is a crucial frontier in artificial intelligence,
with broad applications in many areas, including public health, agriculture,
education, and commerce. However, due to the lack of substantial linguistic
resources, many African languages remain underrepresented in this digital
transformation. This paper presents a case study on the development of
linguistic corpora for three under-resourced Kenyan languages, Kidaw'ida,
Kalenjin, and Dholuo, with the aim of advancing natural language processing and
linguistic research in African communities. Our project, which laste...

### Globalisation of science in kilometres

- **Authors:** Ludo Waltman, Robert J. W. Tijssen, Nees Jan van Eck
- **arXiv ID:** 1103.3648v2
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.3648v2.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  The ongoing globalisation of science has undisputedly a major impact on how
and where scientific research is being conducted nowadays. Yet, the big picture
remains blurred. It is largely unknown where this process is heading, and at
which rate. Which countries are leading or lagging? Many of its key features
are difficult if not impossible to capture in measurements and comparative
statistics. Our empirical study measures the extent and growth of scientific
globalisation in terms of physical distances between co-authoring researchers.
Our analysis, drawing on 21 million research publications...

### Fréchet globalisations of Harish-Chandra supermodules

- **Authors:** Alexander Alldridge
- **arXiv ID:** 1403.4055v2
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.4055v2.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  For any Lie supergroup whose underlying Lie group is reductive, we prove an
extension of the Casselman-Wallach globalisation theorem: There is an
equivalence between the category of Harish-Chandra modules and the category of
SF-representations (smooth Fr\'echet representations of moderate growth) whose
module of finite vectors is Harish-Chandra. As an application, we extend to Lie
supergroups a general general form of the Gel'fand-Kazhdan criterion due to
Sun-Zhu.

### Globalisation and the Decoupling of Inflation from Domestic Labour Costs

- **Authors:** Emanuel Kohlscheen, Richhild Moessner
- **arXiv ID:** 2208.14651v1
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.14651v1.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  We provide novel systematic cross-country evidence that the link between
domestic labour markets and CPI inflation has weakened considerably in advanced
economies during recent decades. The central estimate is that the short-run
pass-through from domestic labour cost changes to core CPI inflation decreased
from 0.25 in the 1980s to just 0.02 in the 2010s, while the long-run
pass-through fell from 0.36 to 0.03. We show that the timing of the collapse in
the pass-through coincides with a steep increase in import penetration from a
group of 10 major manufacturing EMEs around the turn of the mil...

### A Toponogov globalisation result for Lorentzian length spaces

- **Authors:** Tobias Beran, John Harvey, Lewis Napper, Felix Rott
- **arXiv ID:** 2309.12733v2
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12733v2.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  In the synthetic geometric setting introduced by Kunzinger and S\"amann, we
present an analogue of Toponogov's Globalisation Theorem which applies to
Lorentzian length spaces with lower (timelike) curvature bounds. Our approach
utilises a "cat's cradle" construction akin to that which appears in several
proofs in the metric setting. On the road to our main result, we also provide a
lemma regarding the subdivision of triangles in spaces with a local lower
curvature bound and a synthetic Lorentzian version of the Lebesgue Number
Lemma. Several properties of time functions and the null distance...

### Rapid cavity prototyping using mode matching and globalised scattering
  matrix

- **Authors:** I. Shinton, R. M. Jones
- **arXiv ID:** 0903.1936v1
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0903.1936v1.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  Cavity design using traditional mesh based numerical means (such as the
finite element or finite difference methods) require large mesh calculations in
order to obtain accurate values and cavity optimisation is often not achieved.
Here we present a mode matching scheme which utilises a globalised scattering
matrix approach that allows cavities with curved surfaces (i.e. cavities with
elliptical irises and or equators) to be accurately simulated allowing rapid
cavity prototyping and optimisation to be achieved. Results on structures in
the CLIC main

### IT Complexity Revolution: Intelligent Tools for the Globalised World
  Development

- **Authors:** Andrei Kirilyuk, Mihaela Ulieru
- **arXiv ID:** 0910.5495v1
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.5495v1.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  Globalised-civilisation interaction intensity grows exponentially, involving
all dimensions and regions of planetary environment. The resulting dynamics of
critically high, exploding complexity urgently needs consistent understanding
and efficient management. The new, provably universal concept of unreduced
dynamic complexity of real interaction processes described here provides the
former and can be used as a basis for the latter, in the form of "complexity
revolution" in information systems controlling such "critically globalised"
civilisation dynamics. We outline the relevant dynamic comp...

### A globalisation of Jones and Alexander polynomials constructed from a
  graded intersection of two Lagrangians in a configuration space

- **Authors:** Cristina Ana-Maria Anghel
- **arXiv ID:** 2205.07842v2
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.07842v2.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  We consider two Laurent polynomials in two variables associated to a braid,
given by {\em graded intersections} between {\em fixed Lagrangians in
configuration spaces}. In order to get link invariants, we notice that we have
to quotient by a quadratic relation. Then we prove by topological tools that
this relation is sufficient and the first graded intersection gives an
invariant which is the Jones polynomial. This shows a {\em topological model
for the Jones polynomial} and a direct {\em topological proof}\hspace{0.4mm}
that it is a well-defined invariant. The other intersection model in th...

**Abstract:**

  Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a key element of modern marketing
strategies. One of the most practical way to build useful knowledge on
customers in a CRM system to produce scores to forecast churn behavior,
propensity to subscribe to a new service... In AMEA zone (Asia, Middle East and
Africa zone), the context of fierce competition may represent a higher
percentage, and particularly in B2B market. But by contrast, to our knowledge,
no scientific papers were dedicated and published to detail the way to improve

### Business Suitability Principles for Workflow Modelling

- **Authors:** Alistair P. Barros, Arthur H. M. ter Hofstede, Henderik A. Proper, Peter N. Creasy
- **arXiv ID:** 2105.12654v1
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.12654v1.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  By incorporating aspects of coordination and collaboration, workflow
implementations of information systems require a sound conceptualisation of
\EM{business processing} semantics. Traditionally, the success of conceptual
modelling techniques has depended largely on the adequacy of conceptualisation,
expressive power, comprehensibility and formal foundation. An equally important
requirement, particularly with the increased conceptualisation of business
aspects, is \EM{business suitability}. In this paper, the focus is on the
business suitability of workflow modelling for a commonly encounter...

- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.01487v1.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  Startups is a popular phenomenon that has a significant impact on global
economy growth, innovation and society development. However, there is still
insufficient understanding about startups, particularly, how to start a new
business in the relation to consequent performance. Toward this knowledge, we
have performed an empirical study regarding the differences between a Resource
and Competence View (Internal) vs Environment and Market View (External) when
defining a Business. 701 entrepreneurs have reflected on their startups on nine
classes of Resources (values, vision, personal objectives,...

### How Testable is Business Software?

- **Authors:** Peter Schrammel
- **arXiv ID:** 2011.00630v1
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.00630v1.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  Most businesses rely on a significant stack of software to perform their
daily operations. This software is business-critical as defects in this
software have major impacts on revenue and customer satisfaction. The primary
means for verification of this software is testing. We conducted an extensive
analysis of Java software packages to evaluate their unit-testability. The
results show that code in software repositories is typically split into
portions of very trivial code, non-trivial code that is unit-testable, and code
that cannot be unit-tested easily. This brings up interesting consider...

### Exploitation Business: Leveraging Information Asymmetry

- **Authors:** Kwangseob Ahn
- **arXiv ID:** 2310.09802v2
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09802v2.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  This paper investigates the "Exploitation Business" model, which capitalizes
on information asymmetry to exploit vulnerable populations. It focuses on
businesses targeting non-experts or fraudsters who capitalize on information
asymmetry to sell their products or services to desperate individuals. This
phenomenon, also described as "profit-making activities based on informational
exploitation," thrives on individuals' limited access to information, lack of
expertise, and Fear of Missing Out (FOMO).
  The recent advancement of social media and the rising trend of fandom

### The Role Of Social Media On Selected Businesses In Nigeria In The Era Of
  Covid-19 Pandemic

- **Authors:** Cajetan Ihemebiri, Elochukwu Ukwandu, Lizzy Ofusori, Comfort Olebara
- **arXiv ID:** 2305.19299v1
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19299v1.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  As several countries were experiencing unprecedented economic slowdowns due
to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, small business enterprises
started adapting to digital technologies for business transactions. However, in
Africa, particularly Nigeria, COVID-19 pandemic resulted to some financial
crisis that impacted negatively on the sustainability of small and medium-sized
(SMEs) businesses. Thus, this study examined the role of social media on
selected SMEs in Nigeria in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic that led to
several lock downs in a bid to curtail the spread of the viru...

### Business fluctuations in a credit-network economy

- **Authors:** Domenico Delli Gatti, Mauro Gallegati, Bruce Greenwald, Alberto Russo, Joseph E. Stiglitz
- **arXiv ID:** 1006.3521v1
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.3521v1.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  We model a network economy with three sectors: downstream firms, upstream
firms, and banks. Agents are linked by productive and credit relationships so
that the behavior of one agent influences the behavior of the others through
network connections. Credit interlinkages among agents are a source of
bankruptcy diffusion: in fact, failure of fulfilling debt commitments would
lead to bankruptcy chains. All in all, the bankruptcy in one sector can diffuse
to other sectors through linkages creating a vicious cycle and bankruptcy
avalanches in the network economy. Our analysis show how the choices...

### Demographic Dynamics and Artificial Intelligence: Challenges and
  Opportunities in Europe and Africa for 2050

- **Authors:** Mohamed El Louadi
- **arXiv ID:** 2403.03935v2
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03935v2.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  This paper explores the complex relationship between demographics and
artificial intelligence (AI) advances in Europe and Africa, projecting into the
year 2050. The advancement of AI technologies has occurred at diverse rates,
with Africa lagging behind Europe. Moreover, the imminent economic consequences
of demographic shifts require a more careful examination of immigration
patterns, with Africa emerging as a viable labor pool for European countries.
However, within these dynamics, questions are raised about the differences in
AI proficiency between African immigrants and Europeans by 2050...

### clustering an african hairstyle dataset using pca and k-means

- **Authors:** Teffo Phomolo Nicrocia, Owolawi Pius Adewale, Pholo Moanda Diana
- **arXiv ID:** 2306.06061v1
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06061v1.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  The adoption of digital transformation was not expressed in building an
African face shape classifier. In this paper, an approach is presented that
uses k-means to classify African women images. African women rely on beauty
standards recommendations, personal preference, or the newest trends in
hairstyles to decide on the appropriate hairstyle for them. In this paper, an
approach is presented that uses K-means clustering to classify African women's
images. In order to identify potential facial clusters, Haarcascade is used for
feature-based training, and K-means clustering is applied for ima...

**Abstract:**

  Indeed, the global production (as a system of creating values) is eventually
forming like a gigantic and complex network/web of value chains that explains
the transitional structures of global trade and development of the global
economy. It's truly a new wave of globalisation, and we term it as the global
value chains (GVCs), creating the nexus among firms, workers and consumers
around the globe. The emergence of this new scenario asks: how an economy's
firms, producers and workers connect in the global economy. And how are they
capturing the gains out of it in terms of different dimensions ...

### Economic Integration of Africa in the 21st Century: Complex Network and
  Panel Regression Analysis

- **Authors:** Tekilu Tadesse Choramo, Jemal Abafita, Yerali Gandica, Luis E C Rocha
- **arXiv ID:** 2410.21019v1
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21019v1.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  Global and regional integration has grown significantly in recent decades,
boosting intra-African trade and positively impacting national economies
through trade diversification and sustainable development. However, existing
measures of economic integration often fail to capture the complex interactions
among trading partners. This study addresses this gap by using complex network
analysis and dynamic panel regression techniques to identify factors driving
economic integration in Africa, based on data from 2002 to 2019. The results
show that economic development, institutional quality, regio...

### Non-Banking Sector development effect on Economic Growth. A Nighttime
  light data approach

- **Authors:** Leonard Mushunje, Maxwell Mashasha
- **arXiv ID:** 2401.08596v1
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08596v1.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  This paper uses nighttime light(NTL) data to measure the nexus of the
non-banking sector, particularly insurance, and economic growth in South
Africa. We hypothesize that insurance sector growth positively propels economic
growth due to its economic growth-supportive traits like investment protection
and optimal risk mitigation. We also claim that Nighttime light data is a good
economic measure than Gross domestic product (GDP). We used weighted
regressions to measure the relationships between nighttime light data, GDP, and
insurance sector development. We used time series South African GDP ...

### Credit, Land Speculation, and Low-Interest-Rate Policy

- **Authors:** Tomohiro Hirano, Joseph E. Stiglitz
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.23552v2
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23552v2.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  This paper analyses the impact of credit expansions arising from increases in
collateral values or lower interest rate policies on long-term productivity and
economic growth. We show that credit expansions associated with relaxation of
real estate financing (capital investment financing) will be productivity-and
growth-retarding (enhancing). Without financial regulation, expansionary
monetary policy may so encourage land speculation using leverage that
productive capital investment is decreased, leading to low interest rates and
slow economic growth, while generating temporary asset booms. I...

### Machine Intelligence in Africa: a survey

- **Authors:** Allahsera Auguste Tapo, Ali Traore, Sidy Danioko, Hamidou Tembine
- **arXiv ID:** 2402.02218v1
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02218v1.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  In the last 5 years, the availability of large audio datasets in African
countries has opened unlimited opportunities to build machine intelligence (MI)
technologies that are closer to the people and speak, learn, understand, and do
businesses in local languages, including for those who cannot read and write.
Unfortunately, these audio datasets are not fully exploited by current MI
tools, leaving several Africans out of MI business opportunities. Additionally,
many state-of-the-art MI models are not culture-aware, and the ethics of their
adoption indexes are questionable. The lack thereof is...

gender equality, productivity, health, safety, and economic activity. The
results show notable improvements in all areas. Economic activities and
productivity increased significantly among the connected households and

- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00274v1.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  Africa has a very low doctor-to-patient ratio. At very busy clinics, doctors
could see 30+ patients per day -- a heavy patient burden compared with
developed countries -- but productivity tools such as clinical automatic speech
recognition (ASR) are lacking for these overworked clinicians. However,
clinical ASR is mature, even ubiquitous, in developed nations, and
clinician-reported performance of commercial clinical ASR systems is generally
satisfactory. Furthermore, the recent performance of general domain ASR is
approaching human accuracy. However, several gaps exist. Several publications...

**Abstract:**

  This paper discusses the impact of electricity blackouts and poor
infrastructure on the livelihood of residents and the local economy of
Johannesburg, South Africa. The importance of a stable electricity grid plays a
vital role in the effective functioning of urban infrastructure and the
economy. The importance of electricity in the present-day South Africa has not
been emphasized enough to be prioritized at all levels of government,
especially at the local level, as it is where all socio-economic activities
take place. The new South Africa needs to redefine the importance of
electricity by ...

- **arXiv ID:** 2004.12319v1
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12319v1.pdf)

**Abstract:**

  Few African countries have reported COVID-19 case numbers above $1\,000$ as
of April 18, 2020, with South Africa reporting $3\,034$ cases being hit hardest
in Sub-Saharan Africa. Several African countries, especially South Africa, have
already taken strong non-pharmaceutical interventions that include physical
distancing, restricted economic, educational and leisure activities and reduced
human mobility options. The required strengths and overall effectiveness of
such interventions, however, are debated because of simultaneous but opposing
interests in most African countries: strongly limite...
