### 1. Big Data: Understanding Big Data

- **Authors:** Kevin Taylor-Sakyi
- **arXiv ID:** 1601.04602
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.04602v1)

**Abstract:**

Steve Jobs, one of the greatest visionaries of our time was quoted in 1996
saying "a lot of times, people do not know what they want until you show it to
them" [38] indicating he advocated products to be developed based on human
intuition rather than research. With the advancements of mobile devices, social
networks and the Internet of Things, enormous amounts of complex data, both
structured and unstructured are being captured in hope to allow organizations
to make better business decisions as data is now vital for an organizations
success. These enormous amounts of data are referred to as Bi...

### 2. Games from Basic Data Structures

- **Authors:** Mara Bovee, Kyle Burke, Craig Tennenhouse
- **arXiv ID:** 1605.06327
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06327v1)

**Abstract:**

In this paper, we consider combinatorial game rulesets based on data
structures normally covered in an undergraduate Computer Science Data
Structures course: arrays, stacks, queues, priority queues, sets, linked lists,
and binary trees. We describe many rulesets as well as computational and
mathematical properties about them. Two of the rulesets, Tower Nim and Myopic
Col, are new. We show polynomial-time solutions to Tower Nim and to Myopic Col
on paths.

### 3. Structural Induction Principles for Functional Programmers

- **Authors:** James Caldwell
- **arXiv ID:** 1312.2696
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.2696v1)

**Abstract:**

User defined recursive types are a fundamental feature of modern functional
programming languages like Haskell, Clean, and the ML family of languages.
Properties of programs defined by recursion on the structure of recursive types
are generally proved by structural induction on the type. It is well known in
the theorem proving community how to generate structural induction principles
from data type declarations. These methods deserve to be better know in the
functional programming community. Existing functional programming textbooks
gloss over this material. And yet, if functional programmers ...

### 4. A wide-spectrum language for verification of programs on weak memory
  models

- **Authors:** Robert J. Colvin, Graeme Smith
- **arXiv ID:** 1802.04406
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04406v1)

**Abstract:**

Modern processors deploy a variety of weak memory models, which for
efficiency reasons may (appear to) execute instructions in an order different
to that specified by the program text. The consequences of instruction
reordering can be complex and subtle, and can impact on ensuring correctness.
Previous work on the semantics of weak memory models has focussed on the
behaviour of assembler-level programs. In this paper we utilise that work to
extract some general principles underlying instruction reordering, and apply
those principles to a wide-spectrum language encompassing abstract data types

### 5. Anti-Turing Machine

- **Authors:** Viacheslav Dubeyko
- **arXiv ID:** 1903.09653
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.09653v1)

**Abstract:**

The invention of CPU-centric computing paradigm was incredible breakthrough
of computer science that revolutionized our everyday life dramatically.
However, the CPU- centric paradigm is based on the Turing machine concept and,
as a result, expensive and power-hungry data transferring between the memory
and CPU core is inevitable operation. Anti-Turing machine paradigm can be based
on two fundamental principles: (1) data-centric computing, and (2)
decentralized computing. Anti-Turing machine is able to execute a special type
of programs. The commands of such program have to be addressed to the ...

### 6. The Virtues of Conflict: Analyzing Modern Concurrency

- **Authors:** Ganesh Narayanaswamy, Saurabh Joshi, Daniel Kroening
- **arXiv ID:** 1602.08321
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.08321v1)

**Abstract:**

Modern shared memory multiprocessors permit reordering of memory operations
for performance reasons. These reorderings are often a source of subtle bugs in
programs written for such architectures. Traditional approaches to verify weak
memory programs often rely on interleaving semantics, which is prone to state
space explosion, and thus severely limits the scalability of the analysis. In
recent times, there has been a renewed interest in modelling dynamic executions
of weak memory programs using partial orders. However, such an approach
typically requires ad-hoc mechanisms to correctly capture...

### 7. Simplifying Optimal Transport through Schatten-$p$ Regularization

- **Authors:** Tyler Maunu
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.11910
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11910v1)

**Abstract:**

We propose a new general framework for recovering low-rank structure in
optimal transport using Schatten-$p$ norm regularization. Our approach extends
existing methods that promote sparse and interpretable transport maps or plans,
while providing a unified and principled family of convex programs that
encourage low-dimensional structure. The convexity of our formulation enables
direct theoretical analysis: we derive optimality conditions and prove recovery
guarantees for low-rank couplings and barycentric maps in simplified settings.
To efficiently solve the proposed program, we develop a mirr...

### 8. On Some Entertaining Applications of the Concept of Set in Computer
  Science Course

- **Authors:** Krasimir Yordzhev, Hristina Kostadinova
- **arXiv ID:** 1201.3457
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.3457v1)

**Abstract:**

Some aspects of programming education are examined in this work. It is
emphasised, based on the entertainment value, the most appropriate examples are
chosen to demonstrate the different language constructions and data structures.
Such an example is the demonstrated algorithm for solving the widespread
nowadays "Sudoku" puzzle. This is made, because of the connection with the term
set and putting it into practice in the programming. Using the so built program
there are solved some combinatorial problems, connected to the Sudoku matrices.
  Key words: Education in programming, programming langu...

### 9. Can a domain-specific language improve program structure comprehension
  of data pipelines? A mixed-methods study

- **Authors:** Philip Heltweg, Georg-Daniel Schwarz, Dirk Riehle
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.16764
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16764v2)

**Abstract:**

In many application domains, domain-specific languages can allow domain
experts to contribute to collaborative projects more correctly and efficiently.
To do so, they must be able to understand program structure from reading
existing source code. With high-quality data becoming an increasingly important
resource, the creation of data pipelines is an important application domain for
domain-specific languages. We execute a mixed-method study consisting of a
controlled experiment and a follow-up descriptive survey among the participants
to understand the effects of a domain-specific language on b...

### 10. A Visual Language for Composable Inductive Programming

- **Authors:** Edward McDaid, Sarah McDaid
- **arXiv ID:** 2009.08700
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08700v1)

**Abstract:**

We present Zoea Visual which is a visual programming language based on the
Zoea composable inductive programming language. Zoea Visual allows users to
create software directly from a specification that resembles a set of
functional test cases. Programming with Zoea Visual involves the definition of
a data flow model of test case inputs, optional intermediate values, and
outputs. Data elements are represented visually and can be combined to create
structures of any complexity. Data flows between elements provide additional
information that allows the Zoea compiler to generate larger programs in...

### 11. Eye: Program Visualizer for CS2

- **Authors:** Aman Bansal, Preey Shah, Sahil Shah
- **arXiv ID:** 2101.12089
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.12089v1)

**Abstract:**

In recent years, programming has witnessed a shift towards using standard
libraries as a black box. However, there has not been a synchronous development
of tools that can help demonstrate the working of such libraries in general
programs, which poses an impediment to improved learning outcomes and makes
debugging exasperating. We introduce Eye, an interactive pedagogical tool that
visualizes a program's execution as it runs. It demonstrates properties and
usage of data structures in a general environment, thereby helping in learning,
logical debugging, and code comprehension. Eye provides a c...

### 12. Programming an interpreter using molecular dynamics

- **Authors:** J. A. Bergstra, C. A. Middelburg
- **arXiv ID:** 0801.2226
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.2226v1)

**Abstract:**

PGA (ProGram Algebra) is an algebra of programs which concerns programs in
their simplest form: sequences of instructions. Molecular dynamics is a simple
model of computation developed in the setting of PGA, which bears on the use of
dynamic data structures in programming. We consider the programming of an
interpreter for a program notation that is close to existing assembly languages
using PGA with the primitives of molecular dynamics as basic instructions. It
happens that, although primarily meant for explaining programming language
features relating to the use of dynamic data structures, th...

### 13. Circular Programs and Self-Referential Structures

- **Authors:** Lloyd Allison
- **arXiv ID:** 2403.01866
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01866v1)

**Abstract:**

A circular program creates a data structure whose computation depends upon
itself or refers to itself. The technique is used to implement the classic data
structures circular and doubly-linked lists, threaded trees and queues, in a
functional programming language. These structures are normally thought to
require updatable variables found in imperative languages. For example, a
functional program to perform the breadth-first traversal of a tree is given.
Some of the examples result in circular data structures when evaluated. Some
examples are particularly space-efficient by avoiding the creatio...

### 1. Program Skeletons for Automated Program Translation

- **Authors:** Bo Wang, Tianyu Li, Ruishi Li, Umang Mathur, Prateek Saxena
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.07483
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07483v2)

**Abstract:**

Translating software between programming languages is a challenging task, for
which automated techniques have been elusive and hard to scale up to larger
programs. A key difficulty in cross-language translation is that one has to
re-express the intended behavior of the source program into idiomatic
constructs of a different target language. This task needs abstracting away
from the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall
functionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic
approach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a
framework we...

### 2. Functional Programming and Streams

- **Authors:** John MacCormick
- **arXiv ID:** 2302.09403
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09403v1)

**Abstract:**

This document is intended as a stand-alone textbook chapter to be used for
introducing some functional programming concepts into a course in which the
primary teaching language is Java. For details of the approach, please see the
paper "Functional programming, in the data structures course, in Java" by J.
MacCormick, which appears in the Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges
(2023).

### 3. Code Building Genetic Programming

- **Authors:** Edward Pantridge, Lee Spector
- **arXiv ID:** 2008.03649
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03649v1)

**Abstract:**

In recent years the field of genetic programming has made significant
advances towards automatic programming. Research and development of
contemporary program synthesis methods, such as PushGP and Grammar Guided
Genetic Programming, can produce programs that solve problems typically
assigned in introductory academic settings. These problems focus on a narrow,
predetermined set of simple data structures, basic control flow patterns, and
primitive, non-overlapping data types (without, for example, inheritance or
composite types). Few, if any, genetic programming methods for program
synthesis hav...

### 4. Differentiable Functional Program Interpreters

- **Authors:** John K. Feser, Marc Brockschmidt, Alexander L. Gaunt, Daniel Tarlow
- **arXiv ID:** 1611.01988
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01988v2)

**Abstract:**

Programming by Example (PBE) is the task of inducing computer programs from
input-output examples. It can be seen as a type of machine learning where the
hypothesis space is the set of legal programs in some programming language.
Recent work on differentiable interpreters relaxes the discrete space of
programs into a continuous space so that search over programs can be performed
using gradient-based optimization. While conceptually powerful, so far
differentiable interpreter-based program synthesis has only been capable of
solving very simple problems. In this work, we study modeling choices t...

### 5. Distributed Quantum Programming

- **Authors:** Ellie D'Hondt, Yves Vandriessche
- **arXiv ID:** 1001.1722
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.1722v1)

**Abstract:**

In this paper we explore the structure and applicability of the Distributed
Measurement Calculus (DMC), an assembly language for distributed
measurement-based quantum computations. We describe the formal language's
syntax and semantics, both operational and denotational, and state several
properties that are crucial to the practical usability of our language, such as
equivalence of our semantics, as well as compositionality and context-freeness
of DMC programs. We show how to put these properties to use by constructing a
composite program that implements distributed controlled operations, in t...

### 6. Logic programming beyond Prolog

- **Authors:** M. H. van Emden
- **arXiv ID:** 1412.3480
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.3480v3)

**Abstract:**

A logic program is an executable specification. For example, merge sort in
pure Prolog is a logical formula, yet shows creditable performance on long
linked lists. But such executable specifications are a compromise: the logic is
distorted by algorithmic considerations, yet only indirectly executable via an
abstract machine. This paper introduces relational programming, a method that
solves the difficulty with logic programming by a separation of concerns. It
requires three texts: (1) the axioms, a logical formula that specifies the
problem and is not compromised by algorithmic considerations,...

### 7. Searching Entangled Program Spaces

- **Authors:** James Koppel, Zheng Guo, Edsko de Vries, Armando Solar-Lezama, Nadia Polikarpova
- **arXiv ID:** 2206.07828
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07828v1)

**Abstract:**

Many problem domains, including program synthesis and rewrite-based
optimization, require searching astronomically large spaces of programs.
Existing approaches often rely on building specialized data structures --
version-space algebras, finite tree automata, or e-graphs -- to compactly
represent these programs. To find a compact representation, existing data
structures exploit independence of subterms; they blow up when the choices of
subterms are entangled. We introduce equality-constrained tree automata
(ECTAs), a generalization of the three aforementioned data structures that can
efficien...

### 8. The PICARD Payload Data Centre

- **Authors:** G. Pradels, T. Guinle, G. Thuillier, A. Irbah, J-P. Marcovici, C. Dufour, D. Moreau, C. Noel, M. Dominique, T. Corbard, M. Hadjara, S. Mekaoui, C. Wehrli
- **arXiv ID:** 1709.06993
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.06993v1)

**Abstract:**

PICARD is a scientific space mission dedicated to the study of the solar
variability origin. A French micro-satellite will carry an imaging telescope
for measuring the solar diameter, limb shape and solar oscillations, and two
radiometers for measuring the total solar irradiance and the irradiance in five
spectral domains, from ultraviolet to infrared. The mission is planed to be
launched in 2009 for a 3-year duration. This article presents the PICARD
Payload Data Centre, which role is to collect, process and distribute the
PICARD data. The Payload Data Centre is a joint project between labora...

### 9. iSEEtree: interactive explorer for hierarchical data

- **Authors:** Giulio Benedetti, Ely Seraidarian, Theotime Pralas, Akewak Jeba, Tuomas Borman, Leo Lahti
- **arXiv ID:** 2412.02882
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02882v2)

**Abstract:**

$\textbf{Motivation:}$ Hierarchical data structures are prevalent across
several fields of research, as they represent an organised and efficient
approach to study complex interconnected systems. Their significance is
particularly evident in microbiome analysis, where microbial communities are
classified at various taxonomic levels along the phylogenetic tree. In light of
this trend, the R/Bioconductor community has established a reproducible
analytical framework for hierarchical data, which relies on the highly generic
and optimised TreeSummarizedExperiment data container. However, using this...

### 10. Data

- **Authors:** Johannes Reich
- **arXiv ID:** 1801.04992
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04992v2)

**Abstract:**

The contribution of this article is a data concept that is essentially based
on the two concepts of information and computable functionality. In short, data
is viewed as typed information. A data type is defined as a pair of a set of
distinguishable characters (an alphabet) and a set of operations (computable
functions) that operate on this alphabet as domain. Two different ways of
subtyping in the sense of Liskov and Wing are described, one for restriction
and one for extension of existing types. They lead to two different partial
orders on types. It is argued that the proposed data concept m...

### 11. Continual Release of Differentially Private Synthetic Data from
  Longitudinal Data Collections

- **Authors:** Mark Bun, Marco Gaboardi, Marcel Neunhoeffer, Wanrong Zhang
- **arXiv ID:** 2306.07884
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07884v2)

**Abstract:**

Motivated by privacy concerns in long-term longitudinal studies in medical
and social science research, we study the problem of continually releasing
differentially private synthetic data from longitudinal data collections. We
introduce a model where, in every time step, each individual reports a new data
element, and the goal of the synthesizer is to incrementally update a synthetic
dataset in a consistent way to capture a rich class of statistical properties.
We give continual synthetic data generation algorithms that preserve two basic
types of queries: fixed time window queries and cumulat...

### 12. DSDL: Data Set Description Language for Bridging Modalities and Tasks in
  AI Data

- **Authors:** Bin Wang, Linke Ouyang, Fan Wu, Wenchang Ning, Xiao Han, Zhiyuan Zhao, Jiahui Peng, Yiying Jiang, Dahua Lin, Conghui He
- **arXiv ID:** 2405.18315
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18315v1)

**Abstract:**

In the era of artificial intelligence, the diversity of data modalities and
annotation formats often renders data unusable directly, requiring
understanding and format conversion before it can be used by researchers or
developers with different needs. To tackle this problem, this article
introduces a framework called Dataset Description Language (DSDL) that aims to
simplify dataset processing by providing a unified standard for AI datasets.
DSDL adheres to the three basic practical principles of generic, portable, and
extensible, using a unified standard to express data of different modalities...

### 13. Cavity basics

- **Authors:** E. Jensen
- **arXiv ID:** 1201.3202
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.3202v1)

**Abstract:**

The fields in rectangular and circular waveguides are derived from Maxwell's
equations by superposition of plane waves. Subsequently the results are applied
to explain cavity modes. Interaction of the cavity modes with a charged
particle beam leads to the fundamental parameters used to describe the
performance of accelerating cavities. Finally an introduction to multi-gap
cavities is given by the example of travelling-wave structures.

### 14. Basic cosmology

- **Authors:** Ll. Bel
- **arXiv ID:** 1403.5675
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.5675v1)

**Abstract:**

Basic cosmology describes the universe as a Robertson-Walker model filled
with black-body radiation and no barionic matter, and as observational data it
uses only the value of the speed of light, the Hubble and deceleration
parameters and the black-body temperature at the present epoch. It predicts the
value of the next new parameter in the Hubble law.

### 15. Programming interfaces and basic topology

- **Authors:** Peter Hancock, Pierre Hyvernat
- **arXiv ID:** 0905.4063
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0905.4063v1)

**Abstract:**

A pattern of interaction that arises again and again in programming is a
"handshake", in which two agents exchange data. The exchange is thought of as
provision of a service. Each interaction is initiated by a specific agent--the
client or Angel--and concluded by the other--the server or Demon. We present a
category in which the objects--called interaction structures in the
paper--serve as descriptions of services provided across such handshaken
interfaces. The morphisms--called (general) simulations--model components that
provide one such service, relying on another. The morphisms are relatio...

### 16. Computability in Basic Quantum Mechanics

- **Authors:** Eike Neumann, Martin Pape, Thomas Streicher
- **arXiv ID:** 1610.09209
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09209v8)

**Abstract:**

The basic notions of quantum mechanics are formulated in terms of separable
infinite dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. In terms of the Hilbert
lattice $\mathcal{L}$ of closed linear subspaces of $\mathcal{H}$ the notions
of state and observable can be formulated as kinds of measures as in [21]. The
aim of this paper is to show that there is a good notion of computability for
these data structures in the sense of Weihrauch's Type Two Effectivity (TTE)
[26].
  Instead of explicitly exhibiting admissible representations for the data
types under consideration we show that they do live withi...

### 17. Basic Analysis of Bin-Packing Heuristics

- **Authors:** Bastian Rieck
- **arXiv ID:** 2104.12235
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12235v1)

**Abstract:**

The bin-packing problem continues to remain relevant in numerous application
areas. This technical report discusses the empirical performance of different
bin-packing heuristics for certain test problems.

### 18. Increasing the Expressiveness of a Gradual Verifier

- **Authors:** Priyam Gupta
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.13533
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13533v1)

**Abstract:**

Static verification provides strong correctness guarantees for code; however,
fully specifying programs for static verification is a complex, burdensome
process for users. Gradual verification was introduced to make this process
easier by supporting the verification of partially specified programs. The only
currently working gradual verifier, Gradual C0, successfully verifies heap
manipulating programs, but lacks expressiveness in its specification language.
This paper describes the design and implementation of an extension to Gradual
C0 that supports unfolding expressions, which allow more in...

### 19. Semantics of (Resilient) X10

- **Authors:** Silvia Crafa, David Cunningham, Vijay Saraswat, Avraham Shinnar, Olivier Tardieu
- **arXiv ID:** 1312.3739
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.3739v1)

**Abstract:**

We present a formal small-step structural operational semantics for a large
fragment of X10, unifying past work. The fragment covers multiple places,
mutable objects on the heap, sequencing, \code{try/catch}, \code{async},
\code{finish}, and \code{at} constructs. This model accurately captures the
behavior of a large class of concurrent, multi-place X10 programs. Further, we
introduce a formal model of resilience in X10. During execution of an X10
program, a place may fail for many reasons. Resilient X10 permits the program
to continue executing, losing the data at the failed place, and most o...

### 20. A Brief Overview of the Pawns Programming Language

- **Authors:** Lee Naish
- **arXiv ID:** 2409.03152
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03152v1)

**Abstract:**

Pawns is a programming language under development which supports pure
functional programming (including algebraic data types, higher order
programming and parametric polymorphism) and imperative programming (including
pointers, destructive update of shared data structures and global variables),
integrated so each can call the other and with purity checked by the compiler.
For pure functional code the programmer need not understand the representation
of the data structures. For imperative code the representation must be
understood and all effects and dependencies must be documented in the code....

### 21. A systematic review of research on large language models for computer
  programming education

- **Authors:** Meina Zhu, Lanyu Xu, Barbara Ericson
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.21818
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21818v1)

**Abstract:**

Given the increasing demands in computer programming education and the rapid
advancement of large language models (LLMs), LLMs play a critical role in
programming education. This study provides a systematic review of selected
empirical studies on LLMs in computer programming education, published from
2023 to March 2024. The data for this review were collected from Web of Science
(SCI/SSCI), SCOPUS, and EBSCOhost databases, as well as three conference
proceedings specialized in computer programming education. In total, 42 studies
met the selection criteria and were reviewed using methods, inclu...

### 22. T2Script Programming Language

- **Authors:** Piotr J. Puczynski
- **arXiv ID:** 1101.5569
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.5569v1)

**Abstract:**

Event-driven programming is used in many fields of modern Computer Science.
In event-driven programming languages user interacts with a program by
triggering the events. We propose a new approach that we denote command-event
driven programming in which the user interacts with a program by means of
events and commands. We describe a new programming language, T2Script, which is
based on command-event driven paradigm. T2Script has been already implemented
and used in one of industrial products. We describe the rationale, basic
concepts and advanced programming techniques of new T2Script language....

### 23. @C -- augmented version of C programming language

- **Authors:** Iosif Iulian Petrila
- **arXiv ID:** 2212.11245
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11245v1)

**Abstract:**

The augmented version of C programming language is presented. The language
was completed with a series of low-level and high-level facilities to enlarge
the language usage spectrum to various computing systems, operations, users.
The ambiguities and inconsistencies have been resolved by managing problematic
and undefined languages elements through an interpretation and management
similar to that used in the case of other C syntax based languages. The
proposed augmentative completeness elements, through @C approach, preserve the
spirit of C language and its basic characteristics through compati...

### 24. Deadlock detection in linear recursive programs

- **Authors:** Elena Giachino, Cosimo Laneve
- **arXiv ID:** 1310.7449
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.7449v1)

**Abstract:**

Deadlock detection in recursive programs that admit dynamic resource creation
is extremely complex and solutions either give imprecise answers or do not
scale.
  We define an algorithm for detecting deadlocks of "linear recursive programs"
of a basic model. The theory that underpins the algorithm is a generalization
of the theory of permutations of names to so-called "mutations", which
transform tuples by introducing duplicates and fresh names.
  Our algorithm realizes the back-end of deadlock analyzers for object-oriented
programming languages, once the association programs/basic-model-progra...

### 25. Phoenix -- The Arabic Object-Oriented Programming Language

- **Authors:** Youssef Bassil
- **arXiv ID:** 1907.05871
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05871v1)

**Abstract:**

A computer program is a set of electronic instructions executed from within
the computer memory by the computer central processing unit. Its purpose is to
control the functionalities of the computer allowing it to perform various
tasks. Basically, a computer program is written by humans using a programming
language. A programming language is the set of grammatical rules and vocabulary
that governs the correct writing of a computer program. In practice, the
majority of the existing programming languages are written in English-speaking
countries and thus they all use the English language to expr...

### 26. Types, equations, dimensions and the Pi theorem

- **Authors:** Nicola Botta, Patrik Jansson, Guilherme Horta Alvares Da Silva
- **arXiv ID:** 2308.09481
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09481v3)

**Abstract:**

The languages of mathematical physics and modelling are endowed with a rich
"grammar of dimensions" that common abstractions of programming languages fail
to represent. We propose a dependently typed domain-specific language (embedded
in Idris) that captures this grammar. We apply it to explain basic notions of
dimensional analysis and Buckingham's Pi theorem. We hope that the language
makes mathematical physics more accessible to computer scientists and
functional programming more palatable to modelers and physicists.

### 27. An Experiment with a User Manual of a Programming Language Based on a
  Denotational Semantics

**Abstract:**

Denotational models should provide an opportunity for the revision of current
practices seen in the manuals of programming languages. New styles should on
one hand base on denotational models but on the other - do not assume that
today readers are acquainted in this field. A manual should, therefore, provide
some basic knowledge and notation needed to understand the definition of a
programming language written in a new style. At the same time - I strongly
believe that - it should be written for professional programmers rather than
for amateurs. The role of a manual is not to teach the skills o...

### 28. A Note on Dynamic Bidirected Dyck-Reachability with Cycles

- **Authors:** Qirun Zhang
- **arXiv ID:** 2401.03570
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03570v1)

**Abstract:**

Recently, Li et al. [2022] presented a dynamic Dyck-reachability algorithm
for bidirected graphs. The basic idea is based on updating edge weights in a
data structure called the merged graph $G_m$. As noted in Krishna et al.
[2023], the edge deletion procedure described in the algorithm of Li et al.
[2022] cannot properly update the weights in the presence of cycles in $G_m$.
This note discusses the cycle case and the time complexity.

### 29. SEA: String Executability Analysis by Abstract Interpretation

- **Authors:** Vincenzo Arceri, Mila Dalla Preda, Roberto Giacobazzi, Isabella Mastroeni
- **arXiv ID:** 1702.02406
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.02406v1)

**Abstract:**

Dynamic languages often employ reflection primitives to turn dynamically
generated text into executable code at run-time. These features make standard
static analysis extremely hard if not impossible because its essential data
structures, i.e., the control-flow graph and the system of recursive equations
associated with the program to analyse, are themselves dynamically mutating
objects. We introduce SEA, an abstract interpreter for automatic sound string
executability analysis of dynamic languages employing bounded (i.e, finitely
nested) reflection and dynamic code generation. Strings are sta...

### 30. Modular Type-Safety Proofs using Dependant Types

- **Authors:** Christopher Schwaab, Jeremy G. Siek
- **arXiv ID:** 1208.0535
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.0535v1)

**Abstract:**

While methods of code abstraction and reuse are widespread and well
researched, methods of proof abstraction and reuse are still emerging. We
consider the use of dependent types for this purpose, introducing a completely
mechanical approach to proof composition. We show that common techniques for
abstracting algorithms over data structures naturally translate to abstractions
over proofs. We first introduce a language composed of a series of smaller
language components tied together by standard techniques from Malcom (1990). We
proceed by giving proofs of type preservation for each language com...

### 31. Concentration-Bound Analysis for Probabilistic Programs and
  Probabilistic Recurrence Relations

- **Authors:** Jinyi Wang, Yican Sun, Hongfei Fu, Mingzhang Huang, Amir Kafshdar Goharshady, Krishnendu Chatterjee
- **arXiv ID:** 2008.00425
- **URL:** [PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00425v3)

**Abstract:**

Analyzing probabilistic programs and randomized algorithms are classical
problems in computer science. The first basic problem in the analysis of
stochastic processes is to consider the expectation or mean, and another basic
problem is to consider concentration bounds, i.e. showing that large deviations
from the mean have small probability. Similarly, in the context of
probabilistic programs and randomized algorithms, the analysis of expected
termination time/running time and their concentration bounds are fundamental
problems.In this work, we focus on concentration bounds for probabilistic
pr...
